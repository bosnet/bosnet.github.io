## PF inflation

PF(Public Financing) means a financial business model where the Community issues additional BOScoin by its decision via Congress Voting.
The Community makes the decision by reviewing each PF proposal.

Once a PF proposal is suggested which requires the use of a certain volume of BOScoin,
Congress members decide whether to issue and use additional BOScoin via Congress Voting,
depending on the result - additional BOScoin may or may not be issued and used.

Each PF inflation will be transffered to budget account in each PF.
PF inflation is special operation only occur in common budget account.
Planned coin issuance amount and target account address already wrote in proposal.
PF inflation can be issuing  when the Congress voting result records in BOScoin blockchain and 17,280 block confirmed after.
